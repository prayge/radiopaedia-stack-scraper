The lesion has a low signal compared with the surrounding normal cerebellum. On sagittal and axial T2 WI, the tumor shows mild hyperintensity compared with normal brain tissue, with minimal surrounding vasogenic edema. Contrast-enhanced axial T1-WI shows mildly heterogeneous enhancement of the mass. The lesion presents with diffusion restriction, manifested by low ADC values, indicating high tumor cellularity."
